## Overview

![OptiTrain training dashboard](./images/dashboard.png)

OptiTrain is a custom-built, fault-tolerant distributed LLM training and
inference engine designed to sustain workloads on highly ephemeral GPU clusters.

### Key Capabilities

- **Elastic Scaling:** Compute instances can seamlessly join or leave the
  training and inference clusters without interrupting active workloads.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Recovers dead nodes in ~10 seconds utilizing a
  lightweight supervisor and two-tier weight checkpointing.
- **Real-Time Observability:** Tracks cluster health, training progress, and
  latency via a Prometheus and Grafana stack.

### Performance

- **Resilient Training:** Survived 31 injected node failures—including 6
  simultaneously crashing—throughout a 17-hour cross-AZ continuous GPT-2 124M
  training run across 8 AWS GPU instances.
- **High-Throughput Serving:** Custom Go/Kubernetes routing plane sustains
  7,000 RPS (a 9.3× throughput increase over the Python baseline) with 3× lower
  latency.
- **Hardware Efficiency:** Achieved 34x throughput and halved the VRAM footprint
  over vanilla Hugging Face model serving using vLLM continuous batching, KV
  caching, and dynamic datatype casting (bf16, fp16, fp32).

*Built as a solo project to learn more about distributed training and ML
systems.*

## Benchmarks

### Training: 17-hour Chaos Test

A continuous GPT-2 124M training run injected with 31 scheduled node failures to
validate system resilience.

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Model | GPT-2 124M |
| Dataset | OpenWebText |
| Training Time | 17.4 hours |
| Training Loss | 10.40 to 3.10 |
| Fleet | 8x g5.xlarge training instances (NVIDIA A10G)<br>5 Availability Zones within us-east-1 |
| Failures Survived | 31 (~1 every 34 minutes) |
| Catastrophic Events<br>(6/8 nodes destroyed simultaneously) | 2 |
| Median Recovery Time<br>(Time to restore full 8-node world) | 167s |

![Loss — training and validation](./docs/img/flagship-loss.png)

  <em>Training and validation loss across the run. Each red band marks an interval
  during which one or more nodes were down; the system self-healed at every one
  of them, and training continued without a restart.</em>

![Durable progress vs. current frontier](./docs/img/flagship-progress.png)

<p align="center">
  <em>The furthest training step reached rose steadily throughout the run,
  recovering from the last durable checkpoint within seconds of every failure.</em>

  <em>Per-slot occupancy across the run, eight slots in total.<br>
  <b>Green:</b> the node is training and healthy.<br>
  <b>Blue:</b> the node is being replaced.<br>
  <b>Red:</b> one or more nodes have failed.</em>
</p>

### Inference: High-Throughput Serving

Ephemeral workers managed by a stable routing plane.

- **9.3× Throughput:** Custom Go router sustains **7,000 RPS** vs. Python's 750
  RPS, with 3x lower latency.
- **Hardware Efficiency:** Dynamic datatype casting (bf16, fp16, fp32) halves
  VRAM footprint and doubles generation speed.
- **KV Cache Optimization:** Delivers up to a 34x throughput optimization for
  long-context generation relative to the vanilla Hugging Face model.

## System Architecture

### Distributed Training Plane

![Distributed training plane](./images/training.png)

- **Supervisor:** A lightweight control plane monitors heartbeats and publishes
  monotonically numbered "epoch documents" to S3.
- **Stateless Sidecars:** GPU instances run sidecars polling S3. On failure, the
  supervisor updates the epoch, and sidecars dynamically restart `torchrun` at
  the new world size.
- **Two-Tier Checkpointing:** Local NVMe tier for instant survivor restarts;
  asynchronous S3 tier to initialize fresh replacements.

### Resilient Inference Plane

![Resilient inference plane](./images/inference.png)

- **Stable Router:** The only permanent component. Round-robins requests across
  the live set; reroutes automatically on 5xx or transport errors.
- **S3 Registry:** Workers publish 15s TTL heartbeats to S3. Stale nodes are
  silently dropped from rotation without complex consensus protocols.

### Experimental C++ KV transfer

[`kv-transfer-engine/`](./kv-transfer-engine/README.md) adds a standalone TCP
engine for layerwise prefill-to-decode KV transfer, with block remapping,
bounded queues, acknowledgements, CUDA staging, and Python bindings. Its CPU
transport and lifetime tests run independently of the existing serving stack.
The vLLM connector is experimental; GPU round-trip validation, exact-token
parity, and serving performance measurements remain acceptance gates.
